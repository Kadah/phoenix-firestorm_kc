    # achive load itself to another place on the link command line.  If
    # that happens, you can try something like -Wl,-lz here to hide
    # the archive.  Also be aware that the linker will not tolerate a
    # second whole-archive load of the archive.  See viewer's
    # CMakeLists.txt for more information.
